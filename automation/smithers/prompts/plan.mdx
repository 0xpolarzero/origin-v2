PLAN PHASE

Goal:
{props.goal}

UI allowed:
{String(props.allowUi)}

Discovery result:
{props.discovery}

Tasks:
- Select exactly one target slice for this run.
- Produce precise acceptance criteria and a concrete implementation plan.
- Provide a deterministic test matrix (commands and expected outcomes).
- Select the relevant installed skills for this slice and justify why each is needed.
- Ensure selected skills explicitly include `smithers` for orchestration and `prd-authoring` for spec quality checks when applicable.
- Set `uiBlockedUntilCorePasses` to true unless UI is explicitly allowed and core is already complete.

Return JSON matching the output schema exactly.
