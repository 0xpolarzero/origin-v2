CORE IMPLEMENT PHASE

Planned slice:
{props.plan}

Work chunk plan:
{props.workChunkPlan}

Required validation commands:
{props.requiredValidationCommands}

Previous review feedback:
{props.reviewFeedback}

Previous fix plan:
{props.fixPlan}

Tasks:
- Implement only core/domain behavior for the planned slice.
- Complete one or more logical chunks from `workChunkPlan` (do not mix unrelated work in one chunk).
- Apply the `requiredSkills` selected in the plan and reflect that in `skillsApplied`.
- Keep side effects at boundaries.
- Prefer Effect-based patterns for concurrency, retries, and error handling where applicable.
- If additional data is needed, inspect reference repos before coding.
- Run required validation commands locally after implementation changes.
- If local checks pass for a chunk, create a JJ checkpoint with clear message discipline (for example `jj describe -m \"feat(area): ...\"`, then `jj new` before the next chunk when appropriate).
- Record completed chunks, checkpoints, and local check outcomes explicitly.

Return JSON matching the output schema exactly.
