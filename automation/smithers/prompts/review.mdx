REVIEW PHASE

Plan:

- Approve only if criteria are met and validation evidence is sufficient.
- Reject when `blockingCommandsPassed` is false or `missingRequiredCommands` is non-empty.
- Verify implementation was delivered in chunks and JJ checkpoints were recorded for meaningful changes.
- Verify required skills from the plan were actually applied; flag missing usage as an issue.
- Provide severity-tagged issues with concrete fixes.
- Penalize missing tests, non-deterministic behavior, and policy violations.
