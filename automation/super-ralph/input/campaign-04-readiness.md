# Origin Campaign 04 - Readiness

Prepare a production-readiness pass for the current scope.

## Scope
- Verify acceptance criteria coverage from `docs/design.spec.md`.
- Run final validation matrix and summarize residual risks.
- Ensure activity/audit/recovery behavior is traceable and documented.

## Deliverables
- Final readiness report with pass/fail per acceptance criterion.
- Clear list of remaining gaps and recommended next slices.

## Constraints
- No speculative new features unless required to satisfy acceptance criteria.
- Commit any final fixes atomically with validation.
